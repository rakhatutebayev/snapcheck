## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### Problem: Modal doesn't appear

**Solution:**
```bash
# 1. Check browser console (F12)
# 2. Look for JavaScript errors
# 3. Verify ConfirmModal.jsx is imported in Slides.jsx

# 4. Force rebuild
docker-compose down
docker-compose build frontend --no-cache
docker-compose up -d frontend
```

### Problem: Text still in Russian

**Solution:**
```bash
# 1. Clear browser cache completely
# 2. Do hard refresh: Ctrl+Shift+R (Windows/Linux) or Cmd+Shift+R (Mac)
# 3. Check if frontend container restarted

docker-compose ps
docker logs frontend
```

### Problem: Position not restoring

**Solution:**
```bash
# 1. Check backend API response
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" http://localhost:8000/slides/list?presentation_id=1

# 2. Verify last_slide_index in response
# 3. Check browser DevTools Network tab
# 4. Restart backend if needed

docker-compose restart backend
```

### Problem: Toast shows but disappears too quickly

**Solution:**
```
Toast durations are configured in Slides.jsx:
- Success: 3000ms (3 seconds)
- Resuming: 4000ms (4 seconds)
- Error: 5000ms (5 seconds)

To change, edit handleMarkViewed, handleComplete, etc.
```
