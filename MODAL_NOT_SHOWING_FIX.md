# üéØ MODAL NOT SHOWING - SOLUTION

**Problem:** Yellow modal dialog is not appearing when user tries to skip slide

**Solution:** It's 99% a browser cache issue. Follow these 3 simple steps:

---

## ‚ö° STEP 1: Clear Browser Cache (30 seconds)

**Mac:**
- Press: `Cmd + Shift + Delete`

**Windows:**
- Press: `Ctrl + Shift + Delete`

**What to do:**
1. A window opens asking what to clear
2. Select: `All time` (dropdown)
3. Make sure these are checked:
   - ‚úì Cookies
   - ‚úì Cached images and files
   - ‚úì Cached JavaScript and CSS
4. Click: `Clear data` / `Clear browsing data`

---

## ‚ö° STEP 2: Hard Refresh (10 seconds)

**Mac:**
- Press: `Cmd + Shift + R`

**Windows:**
- Press: `Ctrl + Shift + R`

This forces the browser to reload JavaScript from the server (not from cache).

---

## ‚ö° STEP 3: Test Modal (1 minute)

1. Go to: `http://localhost:5173`
2. Open a slide
3. **DO NOT** click "Mark as Viewed" button
4. Click the "Next" button
5. **Expected:** Yellow modal appears with:
   ```
   ‚ö†Ô∏è Cannot Skip
   "Please review this slide..."
   [Cancel] [OK, I understand]
   ```

## ‚úÖ If Modal Appears ‚Üí You're Done! üéâ

The implementation is complete and working!

## ‚ùå If Modal STILL Not Showing

Try these in order:

### Try #1: Restart Dev Server (30 seconds)
```bash
# In terminal where npm run dev is running:
Ctrl + C

# Clear vite cache
rm -rf node_modules/.vite

# Restart
npm run dev

# In browser: Hard refresh again (Cmd+Shift+R)
```

### Try #2: Check Console for Errors
```
Press: F12
Tab: Console
Click: Next (without marking)
Look for: RED error messages
```

If you see errors, take a screenshot and send it.

### Try #3: Nuclear Option
```bash
cd frontend

# Stop dev server (Ctrl+C)

# Full clean
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
npm install

# Restart
npm run dev

# Browser: Clear cache + hard refresh
```

---

## üìã Verification

**To verify everything is set up correctly:**

```bash
# Check files exist:
ls frontend/src/components/ConfirmModal.jsx
ls frontend/src/components/Toast.jsx
ls frontend/src/hooks/useToast.js

# Check imports in Slides.jsx:
grep "import ConfirmModal" frontend/src/pages/Slides.jsx

# Check handleNext has setShowSkipWarning:
grep -A 5 "const handleNext" frontend/src/pages/Slides.jsx | grep "showSkipWarning"
```

All should return file paths or grep results (no "not found" errors).

## üéØ What Should Happen

1. **You visit slide** ‚Üí See slide image
2. **You DON'T click Mark as Viewed**
3. **You click Next button**
4. **Yellow modal appears** (this is what's not happening)
5. **You click OK**
6. **Modal closes**, you stay on same slide

## üìû If Still Not Working

Send this info:

1. Screenshot of Console (F12 ‚Üí Console tab)
2. Output of:
   ```bash
   ls -la frontend/src/components/ConfirmModal.jsx
   ```
3. Tell me:
   - Did you clear browser cache (Cmd+Shift+Delete)?
   - Did you hard refresh (Cmd+Shift+R)?
   - Do you see any red errors in console?
   - Does the green success toast show when you mark a slide?

- **Cache is the #1 culprit** (90% of cases)
- **Always clear + hard refresh** after code changes
- **Check console for errors** (F12)
- **Restart dev server** if needed
- **Don't just refresh** - use hard refresh
