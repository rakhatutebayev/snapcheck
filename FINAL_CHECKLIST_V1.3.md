## 🔍 Verify Code Is Correct

### In `Slides.jsx` line 7:
```jsx
import ConfirmModal from '../components/ConfirmModal';
```
✅ Should be there

### In `Slides.jsx` line 20:
```jsx
const [showSkipWarning, setShowSkipWarning] = useState(false);
```
✅ Should be there

### In `Slides.jsx` line 169 (handleNext):
```jsx
if (!currentSlide.viewed && !isPreviewMode) {
  setShowSkipWarning(true);  // ← This line is KEY
  console.warn('⚠️ User tried to skip slide without marking as viewed');
  return;
}
```
✅ Should have `setShowSkipWarning(true)`

### In `Slides.jsx` line 475+ (render):
```jsx
<ConfirmModal
  isOpen={showSkipWarning}
  type="warning"
  title="Cannot Skip"
  message="Please review this slide and click the 'Mark as Viewed' button before proceeding to the next slide."
  confirmText="OK, I understand"
  onConfirm={() => setShowSkipWarning(false)}
  onCancel={() => setShowSkipWarning(false)}
/>
```
✅ Should be at end before closing `</div>`
